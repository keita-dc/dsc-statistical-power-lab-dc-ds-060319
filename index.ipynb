    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll practice doing a power-analysis during experimental design. As you've seen, power analysis allows you to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. In other words, it allows you to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence, under sample size constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following four factors have an intimate relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample size\n",
    "* Effect size\n",
    "* Significance level = P (Type I error) = probability of finding an effect that is not there\n",
    "* **Power = 1 - P (Type II error)** = probability of finding an effect that is there\n",
    "\n",
    "Given any three of these, we can easily determine the fourth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe the concept of “Power” in relation to p-value and effect size for hypothesis testing\n",
    "* Understand and critically evaluate the factors influencing the power of an experiment\n",
    "* Perform Power calculation using SciPy and Python\n",
    "* Demonstrate the impact of sample size on statistical power using simulations\n",
    "* Demonstrate the combined effect of sample size and effect size on statistical power using simulations  \n",

    "\n",
    "A researcher wants to study how daily protein supplementation in the elderly population will affect baseline liver fat. The study budget will allow enrollment of 24 patients. Half will be randomized to a placebo group and half to the protein supplement treatment group and the trial will be carried out over one month. It is desired to see whether the mean change in percentage of liver fat from baseline to the end of the study differs between the two groups in the study. \n",

    "You've seen how to calculate power given alpha, sample size and effect size. To further investigate this relationship, it is interesting to plot the relationship between power and sample size for various effect sizes. \n",

    "To do this, run multiple simulations for varying parameters. Then store the parameters and plot the resulting dataset. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a value of $\\alpha$ = 0.05 for all of your simulations\n",
    "2. Use the following effect sizes: [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5]\n",
    "3. Use the sample sizes from 10 to 500\n",
    "4. For each effect size sample size combination, calculate the accompanying power\n",
    "5. Plot a line graph of the power vs sample size relationship. You should have 7 plots; one for each of the effect sizes listed above. All 7 plots can be on the same graph, but should be labelled appropriately. Plot the power on the y-axis and sample size on the x-axis."

    "In this lesson, you gained further practice with \"statistical power\" and how it can be used to analyze experimental design. You ran a simulation to determine the sample size that would provide a given value of power (for a given alpha and effect size). Running simulations like this as well as further investigations regarding required sample sizes for higher power thresholds or smaller effect sizes is critical in designing meaningful experiments where one can be confident in the subsequent conclusions drawn."
